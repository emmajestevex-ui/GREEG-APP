# greeg app

Private client build with Supabase key activation and automatic bundled patches.

## What this build does

- Shows the app as `greeg app`.
- Requires a Supabase license key before opening the app.
- Consumes each key one time on the server and binds it to one iOS device ID.
- Re-checks the license on launch, foreground, and every 60 seconds while active.
- Creates the internal `Asset Indexer`, `Shaders`, and `144 fps` patches automatically after activation.
- Shows the extra `TIO GREEG` patch only for the special key `TIO-GREEG927394HD`.
- Lets the client use `Apply`, `Original`, and name editing only.
- Hides Files, Cleaner, Wallpapers, patch creation, import, export, and editing.

Run `supabase/licenses_setup.sql` before using the app. It disables old numeric keys like `GREEG-1`, adds secure key generation, and creates the admin RPC functions.

See `GREEG_BUILD_GUIDE.md` for Supabase setup and GitHub Actions build steps.
